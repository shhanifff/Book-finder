📚 Book Finder Web App

Hi Team ,

I’m excited to share my Take-Home Challenge Submission — a Book Finder Web App built using React, Tailwind CSS, and Axios.

This project helps users like Alex, a college student, search and explore books effortlessly using the Open Library API
.

The Book Finder App allows users to search for books by title and instantly view details such as:
